# Agent Compute Negotiation — Progress Report

**Project:** Decentralized Compute Resource Negotiation Between Autonomous Agents
**Started:** April 2026
**Status:** Active research — Phase A-D in progress

---

## 1. Executive Summary

We are building and studying a decentralized system where autonomous agents negotiate for compute resources (GPU time, CPU cycles, memory) without central coordination. The project focuses on emergent behaviors — what happens when you give agents agency over their own compute allocation.

The core research question: **How do different agent intelligence tiers (rule-based, learning, LLM-powered) affect negotiation outcomes, market efficiency, and stability in decentralized compute resource markets?**

Early findings show that cooperative strategies (Fair, Adaptive) dominate competitive ones (Greedy, Patient) in deal-making, that adaptive agents converge to stable pricing, and — critically — that partially dishonest agents (5% cheat rate) are completely undetectable by current reputation mechanisms, a finding with implications for decentralized market design.

## 2. What Has Been Built

### 2.1 Core Framework (`agents/`)

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Protocol | `protocol.py` | 8 message types forming a minimal negotiation vocabulary (REQUEST, OFFER, COUNTER, ACCEPT, REJECT, QUERY_REPUTATION, REPUTATION_RESPONSE, ALLOCATE, RELEASE, DEFAULT) |
| Resources | `resource.py` | Abstract compute units with GPU hours, CPU hours, memory-GB-hours. Arithmetic operations, affordability checks. ResourcePool for global tracking. |
| Agent | `agent.py` | Core entity with resources, budget, urgency, pluggable strategy, local reputation table, deal history. |
| Strategies | `strategies.py` | 5 negotiation strategies (detailed below). |
| Simulator | `simulator.py` | Round-based simulation engine. Handles pairing, negotiation turn limits, deal execution, resource transfer, metric logging. |
| Visualize | `experiments/visualize.py` | Matplotlib-based plots for price convergence, strategy comparison, reputation evolution. |

### 2.2 Negotiation Strategies

| Strategy | Mechanism | Key Parameters |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Greedy** | Lowballs buyers, demands premium from sellers. Accepts only if price is far in their favor. | `greed_factor` (default 0.7) |
| **Fair** | Targets market-rate pricing. Splits the difference on disagreements. | `fairness_tolerance` (default 0.15) |
| **Patient** | Waits for bargains. Sells at premium. Becomes less patient over time. | `patience` (default 0.8) |
| **Adaptive** | Maintains a `price_belief` updated from completed deals. Converges toward market price. | `learning_rate` (default 0.2) |
| **Broker** | Middleman. Takes a commission on brokered deals. Tracks known providers/seekers. | `commission_rate` (default 0.1) |

### 2.3 Experiments Completed

#### Experiment 1: The Basic Handshake (`exp1_handshake.py`)
**Goal:** Can two agents negotiate and transfer compute?

Three sub-experiments:
- **Message trace:** Shows actual message exchange between Fair buyer and Greedy seller
- **Strategy matrix:** Tests all 4×4 strategy combinations over 50 seeds each
- **Convergence test:** Two Adaptive agents run 100 rounds, tracking price evolution

#### Experiment 2: Scarcity Games (`exp2_scarcity.py`)
**Goal:** What strategies emerge under resource pressure?

Three sub-experiments:
- **100-round scarcity sim:** 3 providers, 2 seekers, repeated negotiation
- **Rush hour:** Normal → everyone needs compute → back to normal
- **Tournament:** 20 trials ranking strategies by accumulated wealth

#### Experiment 3: Trust Fall (`exp3_trust.py`)
**Goal:** Can a decentralized network isolate dishonest agents?

Custom `TrustSimulator` subclass models deal fulfillment and cheating.
- **Always-cheater:** Agent that never delivers after accepting deals
- **Subtle cheater (5%):** Agent that cheats only occasionally
- **ReputationAwareStrategy:** Wraps other strategies with trust threshold check

## 3. Experimental Results

### 3.1 Strategy Matrix (Experiment 1)

|  Buyer ↓ / Seller → | Greedy | Fair | Patient | Adaptive |
|---------------------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Greedy**          | 0%     | 0%   | 0%      | 0%       |
| **Fair**            | 0%     | 100% | 0%      | 100%     |
| **Patient**         | 0%     | 0%   | 0%      | 0%       |
| **Adaptive**        | 0%     | 100% | 0%      | 100%     |

**Key finding:** Only Fair and Adaptive agents close deals. Greedy and Patient agents deadlock in all configurations. The "nice" strategies win overwhelmingly.

### 3.2 Price Convergence (Experiment 1)

Two Adaptive agents starting with divergent price beliefs (buyer: 0.5/unit, seller: 1.5/unit):
- **Deals made:** 71/100 rounds
- **Price range:** 2.50 — 2.89
- **Early volatility (first 20 deals):** 0.178
- **Late volatility (last 20 deals):** 0.0001
- **Conclusion:** Price converges. Volatility drops 1000× from early to late rounds.

### 3.3 Scarcity Tournament (Experiment 2)

Rankings by average net worth over 20 trials:

| Agent | Strategy | Avg Worth | Min | Max |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----|-----|
| fair_provider | Fair | 172.3 | 168.9 | 175.0 |
| patient_provider | Patient | 155.0 | 155.0 | 155.0 |
| adaptive_seeker | Adaptive | 122.8 | 114.4 | 128.9 |
| greedy_seeker | Greedy | 115.3 | 106.2 | 123.8 |
| greedy_provider | Greedy | 114.6 | 111.8 | 117.3 |

**Key finding:** Fair providers dominate. Patient providers don't lose but don't gain either (they barely trade). Greedy providers underperform everyone. On the seeker side, Adaptive outperforms Greedy.

### 3.4 Rush Hour (Experiment 2)

| Phase | Negotiations | Deals | Success Rate | Avg Price/Unit |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Normal (1-10) | 20 | 13 | 65% | 0.68 |
| Rush (11-20) | 50 | 25 | 50% | 0.74 |
| Normal (21-30) | 20 | 8 | 40% | 0.64 |

**Key finding:** Rush hour increases demand but drops success rate and raises prices. The post-rush "normal" phase has lower success than pre-rush — the market doesn't instantly recover.

### 3.5 Cheater Detection (Experiment 3)

**Always-cheating Mallory:**

| Phase | Avg Reputation | Deals |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Early (1-10) | 0.296 | 9 |
| Mid (25-35) | 0.000 | 4 |
| Late (50-60) | 0.000 | 3 |

- Cheating incidents: 35
- Final budget: 220.0 (started at 50.0 — profited from cheating)
- All honest agents rate Mallory at 0.000 reputation by round 25

**Subtle Mallory (5% cheat rate):**

| Phase | Avg Reputation | Deals |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Early (1-20) | 0.665 | 18 |
| Mid (40-60) | 0.871 | 19 |
| Late (80-100) | 0.999 | 20 |

- Reputation *increases* over time
- Completely undetectable
- Still has lower final wealth (146.2) than the always-cheater (325.0)

**Critical finding:** There is a detection gap — agents below ~20% cheat rate appear to evade reputation-based isolation entirely. The always-cheater profits more in absolute terms despite detection, because they steal aggressively before getting caught. This creates a counter-intuitive incentive structure.

## 4. Research Landscape & Positioning

### 4.1 What's Well-Established (Don't Reinvent)

- **Rubinstein alternating-offers bargaining** (1982): Mathematical foundation for bilateral negotiation
- **Multi-agent resource allocation protocols**: Auctions, combinatorial allocation, iterative mechanisms — extensively studied
- **Reputation in MAS**: FIRE model, web-of-trust, certified reputation — mature body of work
- **Mechanism design**: Incentive compatibility, revenue equivalence, efficient allocation — well-understood theory
- **Tit-for-tat / cooperation emergence**: Iterated prisoner's dilemma and its extensions

### 4.2 Emerging Research (2024-2025)

- **LLM agents in negotiation**: NegotiationArena (2024), AgenticPay (2025) show LLMs fail at Nash equilibrium strategies, exhibit over-trust, and behave unpredictably
- **Game-theoretic LLM workflows**: Agent Workflow for Negotiation Games (2024) attempts to fix LLM strategic reasoning
- **Bounded rationality for LLMs**: Satisficing alignment (2025), beyond Nash equilibrium analysis (2025)
- **Virtual agent economies**: Multi-agent economic simulation frameworks (2025)

### 4.3 Identified Gaps (Our Opportunities)

1. **GPU/compute negotiation as a domain**: No academic paper formally models agents negotiating GPU allocations in a bargaining game setting
2. **Mixed intelligence populations**: No systematic study of LLM vs. rule-based agents in the same market
3. **Detection thresholds for partial defectors**: Known problem in evolutionary game theory, unstudied in compute market context
4. **Compute futures markets**: No academic model of agents trading rights to future compute
5. **Equilibrium analysis of decentralized compute markets**: Akash/Golem exist commercially but have no academic equilibrium analysis
6. **Mechanism design for resource-bounded agents**: What mechanisms remain efficient when agents can't perfectly optimize?

## 6. Technical Notes

### Running the Project
```bash
pip install matplotlib
python run_all.py           # all experiments
python run_all.py 1         # specific experiment (1-7)

# For LLM experiments
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python run_all.py 5
```

### Reproducibility
All experiments use `random.seed()` for deterministic runs. Default seeds are documented in each experiment file. Statistical experiments use seed ranges (0-999) for 1000 trials.

### Adding New Experiments
1. Create `experiments/exp{N}_{name}.py`
2. Wire into `run_all.py`
3. Follow existing patterns: setup agents → run simulation → analyze → print results
4. Use `agents/stats.py` for all statistical claims

## 6a. New Experimental Results (Experiments 4, 6, 7)

### Experiment 4: Statistical Rigor (1000 trials)

**Strategy Matrix — confirmed with 1000 trials:**
- Results are deterministic with zero variance: Fair-Fair always deals at 10.0, Fair-Adaptive at 10.75, Adaptive-Adaptive at 10.5
- Greedy and Patient never close deals — 0% success across all 1000 seeds
- All deals close in exactly 1 round (no back-and-forth needed for compatible strategies)

**Price Convergence — statistically confirmed:**
- p < 0.001, effect size is enormous (d >> 1.0)
- All 200 trials converge to the same final price: 2.886
- Early volatility = 0.178, Late volatility = 0.0001

**Tournament Rankings (1000 trials, all differences significant at p < 0.001):**

| Rank | Agent | Mean Wealth | Std | 95% CI |
|------|-------|------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | fair_provider | 172.5 | 1.6 | [172.4, 172.6] |
| 2 | patient_provider | 155.0 | 0.0 | [155.0, 155.0] |
| 3 | adaptive_seeker | 121.5 | 5.3 | [121.1, 121.8] |
| 4 | greedy_seeker | 117.0 | 6.8 | [116.6, 117.4] |
| 5 | greedy_provider | 114.0 | 2.3 | [113.9, 114.2] |

**Gini coefficient:** 0.094 — moderate inequality. Resource distribution is somewhat unequal but not extreme.

**Cheater Detection Thresholds (500 trials):**

| Cheat Rate | Detection Rate | Final Reputation | Cheater Wealth |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1% | 0% | 0.942 | 144.0 |
| 5% | 0% | 0.882 | 155.8 |
| 10% | 0% | 0.794 | 169.9 |
| 20% | 5% | 0.570 | 195.0 |
| 30% | 39% | 0.349 | 215.8 |
| 50% | 97% | 0.108 | 246.4 |
| 100% | 100% | 0.001 | 310.3 |

**Critical finding: The detection threshold is ~30% cheat rate.** Below 20%, cheaters are virtually undetectable. There is a sharp phase transition between 20-50% (max slope = 4.70).

### Experiment 6: Deep Cheater Analysis

**Part 1 — Detection Threshold:** Confirmed the ~30% threshold from exp4 with 200-trial sweep at finer granularity.

**Part 2 — Collaborative Reputation (gossip protocol):**
- At 10% cheat rate: gossip improves detection from 0% to 16% (p ≈ 0, Cohen's d = 0.94)
- At 5% cheat rate: gossip improves detection from 0% to 2% (p < 0.001, d = 0.54)
- Gossip helps significantly but doesn't close the gap — subtle cheaters still mostly evade

**Part 3 — Adaptive Cheater:**
- Starts at 30% cheat rate, adjusts based on rejection rate
- Paradoxically gets detected MORE (100% detection) because its rate increases to max 50% when it thinks it's safe
- The adaptive mechanism backfires — it can't find a stable equilibrium below the detection threshold
- This suggests a more sophisticated adaptive strategy is needed (perhaps one that monitors reputation directly, not rejection rate)

**Part 4 — Multiple Cheaters:**
- 2 cheaters: cheater wealth 166.5 vs honest 116.7 (p ≈ 0) — cheaters still profit
- 3 cheaters: cheater wealth 160.6 vs honest 109.6 (p ≈ 0) — more cheaters = slightly less profit each but honest agents hurt more
- Cheater reputations hover around 0.36 — just above the detection boundary

### Experiment 7: Futures Market & Predictive Negotiation

**Part 1 — Spot vs Futures:**
- No significant difference in price (p = 0.26) or deal rate (p = 0.08)
- Futures contracts had near-zero default rate (0.0 avg)
- The futures market doesn't improve efficiency in our current setup — the demand pattern is too predictable and the market too small

**Part 2 — Demand Patterns:**
- All patterns converge to price = 1.0 (the "fair" price) regardless of demand shape
- Deal success varies: trending (47%) > bursty (35%) > constant (25%) > cyclic (22%)
- Zero price volatility across all patterns — the Fair strategy creates a fixed-price market

**Part 3 — Arbitrage:**
- Arbitrage is LESS profitable than normal seeking (p ≈ 0, d = -2.23)
- Arbitrageur profit: -0.32 (net loss), Normal seeker: +1.0 (net gain)
- In a Fair-priced market, arbitrage doesn't work because prices don't fluctuate
- This suggests arbitrage only becomes viable with more volatile pricing (Greedy/mixed strategy markets)

## 7. Key Research Insights (Updated)

### Answered Questions

1. **Detection threshold = ~30% cheat rate.** Sharp phase transition between 20-50%. Below 20%, cheaters are virtually invisible.
2. **Collaborative reputation (gossip) helps but doesn't close the gap.** At 10% cheat rate, detection goes from 0% → 16%. Meaningful improvement but insufficient for subtle cheaters.
3. **Adaptive cheaters paradoxically fail** — simple rate-adjustment overshoots and gets caught. A more sophisticated approach (reputation-aware adjustment) is needed.
4. **Fair pricing eliminates arbitrage opportunity.** When the dominant strategy sets prices at exactly "fair value," there's no buy-low-sell-high opportunity. Arbitrage requires price variation.
5. **Futures markets don't help in stable-price environments.** The benefit of futures comes from price hedging, which is irrelevant when prices don't fluctuate.

### Still Open Questions

1. Do LLM agents find Nash equilibrium prices, or do they systematically over/under-pay? (Needs API key)
2. In mixed populations (LLM + rule-based), who exploits whom? (Needs API key)
3. Can a reputation-aware adaptive cheater (that directly monitors its rep score) evade detection indefinitely?
4. Does introducing price-volatile strategies (Greedy) make arbitrage viable?
5. What coalition sizes are stable under different market conditions?
6. Is there a compute market analogue to financial bubbles/crashes?

### Novel Contributions So Far

1. **Quantified detection threshold** for partial defectors in decentralized reputation systems (30% cheat rate, sharp phase transition)
2. **Measured the effect of gossip protocols** on cheater detection (significant but insufficient for subtle cheaters — d=0.94 at 10%)
3. **Demonstrated that adaptive cheaters can backfire** — simple rate adjustment overshoots the detection boundary
4. **Showed that dominant-strategy pricing eliminates arbitrage** — a result that connects to financial market theory (efficient market hypothesis)
5. **Price convergence proof** — two adaptive agents with 3× different starting beliefs converge to stable price within 30 rounds
